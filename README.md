## 🚀 Deployment Highlights

* **Architecture**: Decoupled Frontend and Admin apps to ensure independent scaling and zero-conflict builds.
* **Environment Management**: Configured with `VITE_BACKEND_URL` to allow seamless switching between local and production APIs.
* **Case Sensitivity**: Optimized for Linux-based CI/CD (Vercel) by enforcing strict naming conventions for components.
